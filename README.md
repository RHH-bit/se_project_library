# Triple Peaks Library

This is the first project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project Features

- Semantic HTML 5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- layered images
- vertical stacking with z-index

## Plan on improving the project

Improvments would be adding Social Media links that dont exist.
Changing the color of the header and discription as of right now it may be a bit hard to read for some at different screen sizes.
As well as adding screen sizes for the whole page for different devices.
Other then that it is the final form for my school project.
